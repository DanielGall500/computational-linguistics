# Computational Linguistics Research

Welcome to my **Computational Linguistics Research** repository! This collection hosts a series of small research papers and explorations across various subfields of computational linguistics.

## 📚 Topics Covered
This repository includes papers and notes on the following areas:
- Computational modeling of theoretical linguistic phenomena from Minimalism.
- Investigating syntactic distributions in **Irish**, **German** and **Polish**.
- A couple small assignments relating to trees and context trees.

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks
- [**Universal Dependencies (UD)**](https://universaldependencies.org/) – Cross-linguistic syntactic annotation
- [**TüNDRA**](https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/Tundra/about#:~:text=What%20is%20T%C3%BCNDRA%3F,complex%20annotation%20and%20syntactic%20links.) – Querying UD treebanks
- [**GREWMatch**](https://universal.grew.fr/) – Graph-based querying for syntactic patterns

## 📊 Research Goals
- Explore formal syntactic theories through computational methods.
- Analyse and compare syntactic distributions across languages.
- Leverage query languages to investigate linguistic phenomena.
